NFA to DFA Conversion Tool | Python, Flask, Graphviz |
Designed and implemented algorithms in Python for converting Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), ensuring accurate state transitions and minimal states.
Developed a responsive web interface using Flask and integrated Graphviz for visualizing DFA graphs dynamically based on user inputs.
Implemented optimizations to improve performance and scalability of the conversion process, resulting in efficient DFA generation from complex NFAs.

Note:The CSS for the website is still to be done.Minimal CSS is used for now.Will update it soon.
